About Me
Rachel Pazos
Hello everyone! I'm married with three children. I'm working on a degree in Applied Technology. 
I like leaning about different career paths in tech since I'm not sure what I'll end up doing with my degree. 
I have loved studying online with BYUI as I have been able to work with other people around the world.
I have been a member of the church my whole life and I love to learn all that I can about the gospel. I love spending
time with my family, being outdoors, and listening to podcasts while working around the house. My favorite podcasts are
Small Town Dicks, Mr. Ballen, All In, and Miracle Files. I look forward to working with everyone.  Here's to a great semester!
